        <h3>Shoe</h3>
        <p id="p1">
                <img src="images/image copy 2.png" id="pic1">  I have black and white <a href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/">Under Armour</a> shoes, which were purchased a while ago when they were on sale. Having been worn for several years, they are in rather poor condition, which continues to deteriorate each day. The souls are completely grinded down on the heels, and the cartilage in the back part of the shoe (wraps around your heel) is gone, as I had to tear it out after it became bent and began pressing into/stabbing the back of my foot. However, as a result, the shoes have become spacious and <span class="highlight">comfortable</span>, and (crucially) absurdly easy to take on and off. They have not lost their effectiveness nor too much of their outward appearance, and their status of being in their final days removes any fear of getting them dirty or wanting to avoid certain areas. Thus, despite heavy insistence from my parents, I have elected to continue wearing them in the face of buying new ones, and have no intention of doing otherwise until they are utterly and objectively dysfunctional.

<h3>Dog</h3>
<p id="p2">
<img src="images/image copy.png" id="pic2">
I have a dog. She is a breed of poodle and sheepdog <span class="highlight">(sheepadoodle)</span>, and is about 70 <a href="https://www.unitconverters.net/weight-and-mass/lbs-to-kg.htm">pounds</a> and over four feet long. Her hair is thick and black, as is expected, but since it matted easily and bothered her (got in her eyes and mouth) we typically keep it trimmed shorter, which unfortunately prevents her from reaching the stereotypical sheep dog appearance. She doesn’t shed much, but finds other methods of being extremely high maintenance. She is extremely social and barks anytime someone leaves her company without her approval, and her intense friendliness means that new dogs are tested on her at the daycare place we occasionally drop her off at (if a dog can’t be friends with her, they are unfit to stay at the location).

<h3>Siblings</h3>
<p>
<img src="images/image.png" id="pic3">
My oldest brother is 20, and currently attending college at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis</a> with a major in microbiology. He is approximately 5’11 and about 160-170 pounds, and is characterized by his considerable appetite and disregard for general hygiene. He went to <span class="highlight">CCA</span> for four years, and played for the high school soccer team for his latter three, though his horrendous performances and depressingly low skill level lead to his primary position being a benchwarmer. He is extremely loud and enjoys attention, which is ironic given that his obnoxious behavior fills anyone who gives it to him with sorrow, regret, and a promise to do their best to avoid him for the remainder of their permanently tainted life. He has broken several bones, and was famously out injured for nearly the entirety of the soccer season during his senior year on account of multiple (consecutive) concussions.
